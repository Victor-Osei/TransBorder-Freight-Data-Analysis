# TransBorder-Freight-Data-Analysis

### Overview
The TransBorder Freight Data Analysis project aims to uncover insights into the efficiency, safety, and performance of freight transportation across North America. Using data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), this analysis will identify patterns, operational inefficiencies, safety risks, and economic factors influencing cross-border trade. 


This project is to analyze the transportation data provided by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) to uncover insights related to the efficiency, safety, and environmental impacts of freight transportation across various modes (road, rail, air, and water). 


### Key Analytical Questions
The analysis will address the following questions:
1. What are the trends in freight volume over time across different transportation modes?
2. Which regions or borders experience the highest and lowest freight traffic?
3. Where are the major operational bottlenecks, and how do they affect throughput?
4. What are the most common safety incidents, and how can they be mitigated?
5. How do global economic events impact cross-border freight movements?
6. Which commodities dominate freight transportation, and how does this vary by mode?
7. What are the cost trends associated with freight transportation across regions and modes?


## **Hypothesis**
The project will test the following hypothesis:  
**Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: Freight transportation costs are independent of the mode of transportation.  
**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: Freight transportation costs vary significantly by the mode of transportation.  

This hypothesis will be tested to determine if transportation modes influence costs, which can inform strategies for optimizing freight expenditures.



## **CRISP-DM Framework**
### 1. **Business Understanding**
   - **Business Objective**:
The goal is to analyze cross-border freight transportation data to uncover inefficiencies, environmental impacts, and safety risks while identifying trends and patterns that can lead to actionable insights. The ultimate aim is to improve the efficiency, sustainability, and safety of the transportation system.

   - **Success Criteria**: Insights leading to improved operational efficiency, reduced delays, and enhanced safety.

### 2. **Data Understanding**
   - **Data Source**: Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS).
   - **Data Includes**:
     - Geographical codes (e.g., ports, states, regions, country).
     - Container codes
     - Commodity classifications.
     - Transportation modes (road, rail, air, water, etc.).
     - Trade types (import/export).
     - Freight charges, 
     - Shipping weight and Value.

   - Creating visualizations for exploratory analysis.

### 4. **Analysis**
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns.
   - Test the hypothesis on transportation cost variability by mode.
   - Use statistical methods to answer analytical questions and derive insights.

### 5. **Evaluation**
   - Validate findings through robust statistical methods.
   - Ensure insights are actionable and aligned with business goals.

### 6. **Deployment**
   - Develop visual dashboards and reports for stakeholders.
