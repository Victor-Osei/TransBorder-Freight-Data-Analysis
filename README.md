# TransBorder-Freight-Data-Analysis

### Overview
The TransBorder Freight Data Analysis project aims to uncover insights into the efficiency, safety, and performance of freight transportation across North America. Using data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), this analysis will identify patterns, operational inefficiencies and economic factors influencing cross-border trade. 


This project is to analyze the transportation data provided by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) to uncover insights related to the efficiency, and geographical impacts of freight transportation across various modes (road, rail, air, and water). 


### Key Analytical Questions
The analysis will address the following questions:
1. What is the distribution of trade types (import/export) across different transportation modes?
2. Which country is the top trading partner in terms of total trade value?
3. How does the shipping weight vary across different transportation modes?
4. What are the trends in trade value over the years?
5. Which commodities have the highest trade value?
6. How do freight charges vary by transportation mode and trade type?
7. What is the relationship between shipping weight and frieght charges?


## **Hypothesis**
The project will test the following hypothesis:  
**Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: Freight charges are independent of the mode of transportation.

**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: Freight charges vary significantly by the mode of transportation.

This hypothesis will be tested to determine if transportation modes influence costs, which can inform strategies for optimizing freight expenditures.



## **CRISP-DM Framework**
### 1. **Business Understanding**
   - **Business Objective**:
The goal is to analyze cross-border freight transportation data to uncover inefficiencies, environmental impacts, and safety risks while identifying trends and patterns that can lead to actionable insights. The ultimate aim is to improve the efficiency, sustainability, and safety of the transportation system.

   - **Success Criteria**: Insights leading to improved operational efficiency, reduced delays, and enhanced safety.

### 2. **Data Understanding**
   - **Data Source**: Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS).
   - **Data Includes**:
     - Geographical codes (e.g., ports, states, regions, country).
     - Container codes
     - Commodity classifications.
     - Transportation modes (road, rail, air, water, etc.).
     - Trade types (import/export).
     - Freight charges, 
     - Shipping weight and Value.
     - Year

 ### 3. **Data Preparation**
   - Cleaning and preprocessing raw data.
   - Handling missing values and duplicates
   - Creating visualizations for exploratory analysis.
   

### 4. **Analysis**
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns.
   - Use statistical methods to answer analytical questions and derive insights.
   - Test the hypothesis to compare freight charges across different transportation modes
   

### 5. **Evaluation**
   - Ensure insights are actionable and aligned with business goals.

### 6. **Deployment**
   - Developed visual dashboard and report for stakeholders using Power BI.
